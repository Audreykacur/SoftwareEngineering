Analysis
- Analysis focuses on an investigation of the problem and requirements.
	“What will the system do?”
	E.g.:
	- Requirements analysis – an investigation of the requirements
	- Object-oriented analysis – an investigation of domain objects

Design
- Design focuses on a conceptual solution that fulfills the requirements, rathe than on implementation.
	“How will the system fulfill the requirements?”
	E.g.:
	- Object-oriented design – design of software objects
	- Database design – design of database schema

Concept Definition
- What is a concept? An idea, thing, or object.
	An object can be:
	- Represented symbolically
	- Defined or described
	- Exemplified
	Examples:
	- Agency
	- Applicant

Model
- We will use models when developing software.
- Model is a simplification of reality which helps to better understand the system under development.
- We will visualize models using Unified Modeling Language (UML).

Engineering Approach
- Before we start with software development, we will model and visualize the system.
- We will use established notation, methods, and workflows.
- The software will be programmed according to the model that was created by the software architect, analyst, and designer.

Domain model 
- Domain model is not a description of software objects.
- It is a visualization of the concepts (it is also called a conceptual object model).

These diagrams show software classes.
- Sequence diagram = dynamic view of collaborating objects
- Class diagram = static view of collaborating objects

“The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a visual language for specifying, constructing and documenting the artifacts of systems.”
- Visual = diagramming notation for drawing or presenting pictures (with some text)

Three Ways to Apply UML
- UML as sketch – informal and incomplete diagrams created to explore difficult parts of the problem or solution.
- UML as blueprint – relatively detailed design diagrams used either for
	- Reverse engineering
	- Code generation (forward engineering)
- UML as programming language

Three Perspectives to Apply UML
- Conceptual perspective – the diagrams describe real things.
- Specification (software) perspective – the diagrams describe software abstractions or components with specifications and interfaces.
 - Implementation (software) perspective – the diagrams describe software implementations in a particular technology

 Unified Process
- A software development process describes an approach to building, deploying, and possibly maintaining software.
- The Unified Process is an iterative software development process for building object-oriented systems.

Iterative Development
- Development is organized into a series of short, fixed-length (for example, threeweek) mini-projects called iterations.
- The outcome of each iteration is a tested, integrated, and executable partial system.
- Each iteration includes its own requirements analysis, design, implementation, and testing.
- The system grows incrementally over time, iteration by iteration, and thus this approach is also known as iterative and incremental development.
- Because feedback and adaptation evolve the specifications and design, it is also known as iterative and evolutionary development.
- Each iteration involves choosing a small subset of the requirements, and quickly designing, implementing, and testing.
- The act of taking a small step before all requirements are finalized, or the entire design is speculatively defined, leads to rapid feedback from the users, developers, and tests (such as load and usability tests).

Benefits of Iterative Development
- Less project failure, better productivity, and lower defect rates
- Early rather than late mitigation of high risks (technical, requirements, objectives, usability, and so forth)
- Early visible progress
- Early feedback, user engagement, and adaptation leading to a refined system that more closely meets the real needs of the stakeholders.
- Managed complexity; the team is not overwhelmed by “analysis paralysis”.
- The learning within an iteration can be methodically used to improve the development process itself.

Timeboxing
- A typical iteration lasts between two and six weeks.
- A key idea is that iterations are timeboxed (fixed in length).
- If it seems that it will be difficult to meet the deadline, the recommended response is to remove tasks or requirements from the iteration, and include them in a future iteration, rather than slip the completion date

Waterfall
- In a waterfall (or sequential) lifecycle process, there is an attempt to define (in detail) all or most of the requirements before programming.
- It is strongly associated with high rates of failure, lower productivity, and higher defect rates (than iterative projects).
- Analysis -> Design -> Implementation -> Testing -> Deployment 

Change in Software Development
- Change is the constant on software projects.
- Any analysis, modeling, development, or management practice based on the assumption that things are long-term stable is fundamentally flawed.
- Iterative and evolutionary methods assume and embrace change and adaptation of partial and evolving specifications, models, and plans based on feedback.
