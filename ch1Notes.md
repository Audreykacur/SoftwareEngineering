CHAPTER 1 NOTES

OOD - object oriented design 
OOA - object oriented analysis

UML 
- Unified modeling language : a visual language for specifing, constructing and documenting the artifacts of systems 
- standard diagramming notation : for drawing or presenting pictures related to software 
- you apply UML in the service of doing OOA/D 

Interative development 


nine fundamental principles in object design and responsibility assignment 
- GRASP of principles 

Analysis - investigation of the problem and requirements rather than a solution 
	- how will it be used 
	- what are the requirements 
requirements analysis - an investigation of the requirements (could include scenarios of how the application would be used - use cases)
object oriented analysis - an investigation of the domain objects 

Design - conceptual solution: fulfills the requirements rather than the implementation 
	- a description of a database and software objects 


OOA - findind and describing the objects or concepts in the problem domain

OOD - there is an emphasis oon defininig software objects and how they collaborate to fulfill the requirements 

Domain model (Conceptual object model) - a diagram of how the system works : a visualization of the concepts or mental models of a real world domain : models real world classes

Sequence diagram - illustration of software collaboratoins : UML interaction diagram : Shows thee flow of messages between software objects and the invocation of methods (in the define interaction diagram)

Design class diagram - a static view of the class definitions is shown : illistrates the attributes and methods of the classes : shows the software classes : Supports a lower representational gap between the software conponents and oour mental models of a domain

Define use cases -> Define domain model -> Define interaction diagrams -> Define design class diagrams 

Conceptual class - real world concept or thingh (a concept or essential perspective) : UP Domain model contains conceptual classes 

Software class - a class representing a specification or implementation perspective of a software component regardless of the process or method 

Implementation class - a class implementated in a specific OO (object oriented) language such as Java
